h2. FFMpeg

A DSL for building and executing ffmpeg commands.

h2. Requirements

It requires that you already have ffmpeg installed, obviously :)

h2. Install

gem install polly-ffmpeg --source http://gems.github.com

h2. Usage

To build and execute a command you would use the FFMpeg::convert method and then call the FFMpeg::run method like this:

require "rubygems"
require "ffmpeg"
include FFMpeg

convert "file.ext", :to => "new_file.ext" do
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seek     "00:01:13"</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duration "00:10:01"</span>
end.run

If you want the output file to have the same name as the input file it's enough to just specify the new file extension like this:

require "rubygems"
require "ffmpeg"
include FFMpeg

convert "finding_that_nemo_dude.avi", :to => :flv do
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span>
end

This will produce an output file called finding_that_nemo_dude.flv

h2. Credit where credit's due

Thank's to "jwthompson2":http://github.com/jwthompson2 there's now support for all of the standard video and audio options and most of the advanced video options from the ffmpeg documentation as well 
as improved and refactored specs.

Thanks to "jamesdaniels":http://github.com/jamesdaniels for fixing a nasty output path error while using the :to => extension option
